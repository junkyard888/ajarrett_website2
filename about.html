    <h1>Bio</h1>

<div class="bio_picture">
</div>

<p>Creating and curating the new wave of highly influential urban never-look-back music, Bladee first started gaining notoriety in 2014 for his self-released, emotionally charged take on rap; obscure and futuristic DIY tracks that quickly established an obsessive cult following in the cut-throat worlds of music and fashion alike.
His sound have constantly been expanding and evolving since; twisted yet nuanced autotuned voices float on top of dark, angelic beats with an abundance of bass, lethal melodies and broken down rhythms as proven on standout solo album “Eversince”, released in 2016.
Bladee unveiled his second studio album ”Red Light” in early 2018, a release followed up by a sold-out show at O2 Academy Islington in London plus him taking the helm as creative director for Yung Lean ́s Sadboys Gear brand shorty thereafter.
